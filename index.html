                                    🌐 About Me – First Semester Web Design Project
                                    This was my first real dive into web development, built during my first semester of college. 
                                    The project was all about creating a personal website using just HTML and CSS—no templates, no shortcuts. I remember feeling both overwhelmed and excited as I learned to craft something from scratch that was entirely my own. 
                                    This site showcases my bio, family, hobbies, and career history, with creative use of CSS to make it uniquely mine. Looking back now, 
                                    it's amazing to see how far I've come in my coding journey, but this project will always hold a special place in my heart as the starting point for everything I’ve built since!

                                    🧊 Steed Arena – Systems Analysis
                                    This was a team project for my Systems Analysis & Design class where we worked with a real business; 
                                    Helena’s only ice rink. We thought we’d be fixing their ticket system, but after talking to the owner, we realized the real problem was energy costs. 
                                    So, we pivoted and focused on solutions like solar panels, compressor upgrades, and humidity control. It was one of those projects that reminded me why I love tech! 
                                    Real problems, real people, and real impact.

                                    🌐 Bearded Pixels Admin Panel – Photography Business Web App
                                        This project represents a major step forward in my web development journey. 
                                    It’s a full-stack admin dashboard I built from the ground up to manage a photography business, Bearded Pixels Studio. 
                                    Using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL, I created a system where I can easily upload, edit, and organize photos and albums, no more manual site updates! 
                                    It was both challenging and exciting to build something this dynamic and useful. Looking back, it’s incredible to see how far I’ve grown—from writing basic HTML to engineering my own backend systems. 
                                    This project showed me just how powerful code can be when it's built with purpose.

                                    🌐 Ashley Madison Breach – Application Security Case Study
                                    This project was part of my Application Security course, and it gave me the chance to investigate a real-world cyberattack with serious technical and ethical implications. 
                                    I chose the 2015 Ashley Madison data breach because it wasn’t just about hacking—it was about broken trust, poor security practices, and the real human cost of digital negligence. 
                                    Through this project, I explored how the attack happened, what went wrong behind the scenes, and what developers and companies can learn from it today.
                                    It was a powerful reminder that cybersecurity isn’t optional; It’s foundational.

                                    🗄️ Bearded Pixels Studio – PostgreSQL Database for a Full-Stack Photography App
                                        This database is the heart of the Bearded Pixels Studio project. It’s where all the photos, albums, clients, bookings, and admin data live. 
                                    I designed and built this schema from the ground up to support a dynamic, real-world photography business—and it became one of my favorite parts of the entire project.
                                    Using PostgreSQL, I created a clean, relational structure that makes managing the business easy and efficient. Every photo connects to an album, every client can book sessions, and every order has its own details.
                                    Looking back, building this database was a huge leap for me. It taught me how to think about data from a systems perspective and how to support a full-stack app with a strong, well-organized backend.

                                This project is the foundation of my home lab. It’s a Proxmox server I built from the ground up, piece by piece, and configured to power my personal network and future virtual environments. 
                                    At its core, it runs OPNsense in an LXC container to act as my firewall and router, with WireGuard set up for secure remote access from my laptop and phone. 
                                    I also mirrored my storage drives for both speed and redundancy and turned an old TP-Link router into an access point with separate networks for guest, IoT, and private devices.
                                    Getting everything installed, virtualized, and connected wasn’t easy—but that’s what made it so rewarding. 
                                    I learned how to manage a network, configure firewall rules, and lay the groundwork for future services and self-hosted tools. 
                                    It’s the backbone of my home infrastructure and one of the most hands-on tech builds I’ve done so far.

                                This solo project was part of my Independent Study course, and I used it as an opportunity to dive into something totally new: 3D modeling with Blender. 
                                    I challenged myself to create my dream art room, starting from scratch with basic shapes and building everything by hand, from paintbrushes to furniture.
                                    What began as a curiosity turned into a surprisingly deep experience blending creativity, design, and tech. 
                                    I didn’t use any premade assets. I walked away with a solid foundation and a lot of pride in learning something completely outside my usual toolkit.</p>
