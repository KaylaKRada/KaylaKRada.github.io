## 🧭 Overview  
Welcome to my professional portfolio for the CSCI 299 Capstone course! This collection showcases the strongest and most meaningful projects I’ve completed throughout my time in the Computer Technology program. Each project here reflects key concepts in software development, web design, networking, cybersecurity, and systems management—plus my own unique touch.

This portfolio not only serves as a reflection of my academic growth, but as a launchpad for my professional career. From fun, beginner-friendly Java programs to complex full-stack web apps and a fully functioning home server with Proxmox, OPNsense, and WireGuard, every project taught me something new and valuable.

Whether you’re a potential employer, mentor, or fellow technologist, I hope you’ll find something that sparks interest and shows you who I am as both a developer and a creator.
